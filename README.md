I like to make complicated stuff easy to understand through design as a UX designer with a passion for software and web development. For more than 15 years I've been obsessed with solving real user problems through design. By stripping away the unnecessary and drawing out the essential, I bring ideas from concept to pixel perfect implementation. 

Working in a diverse set of teams in the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Spain has allowed me to create compelling products and processes that empower customers to achieve more.

Send me a message if you think we'd vibe and could help each other build awesome products.
